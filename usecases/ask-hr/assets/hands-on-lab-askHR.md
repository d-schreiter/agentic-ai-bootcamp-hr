## Use Case Description

This use case targets developing and deploying an AskHR agent leveraging IBM watsonx Orchestrate, as depicted in the provided architecture diagram. This agent will empower employees to interact with HR systems and access information efficiently through conversational AI. 

In this lab we will build an HR agent in watsonx Orchestrate, leveraging tools and external knowledge to connect to a simulated Human Capital Management System. This agent retrieves relevant information from documents to answer user queries and  allows users to view and manage their profiles.

Additionaly, IBM watsonx Orchestrate provides an easy access to pre-built domain agents and tools, including those in the HR domain, for example SAP Successfactors, Oracle HCM, and Workday. Agents can be created from a template in one click, then modified and extended as needed.  This optinal part of the lab will give you access to the SAP Employee Support Manager Agent that you can see in action by testing out with a few sample queries. 

In a real enterprise scenario it is recommended to start with pre-built domain agents and tools. You can easily create your own agent from an existing template and then modify and extend as needed, for example bringing in additional tools, agents, and connections.

## Pre-requisites

**Instructors**: 
- Check the corresponding [Instructor's guide](https://github.ibm.com/skol/agentic-ai-client-bootcamp-instructors/tree/main/usecase-setup/askhr) repo to set up all environments and backend services.

- Ensure you have provided an updated OpenAPI Spec located in the instructor repo at `usecase-setup/askhr/HCM_APP/hr.yaml` with the correct URL to your deployed backend service for the lab participants.
- Provide the [list of employees](https://github.ibm.com/skol/agentic-ai-client-bootcamp-instructors/blob/main/usecase-setup/askhr/HCM_APP/users_data.xlsx) and assign one to each student for testing.
- Ensure you have set up a shared watsonx Orchestrate tenant and configured the SAP connections (optional part)

   ```
   Use your knowledge base to answer general questions about employee benefits. 

   Use the tools to get or update user specific information.

   When user asks to show profile data or check time off balance or update title/address or request time off for the very first time,  first ask the user for their name,  then invoke the tool and then use the same name in the whole session without asking for the name again.

   When the user requests time off, convert the dates to YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. 5/22/2025 should be converted to 2025-05-22 before passing the date to the post_request_time_off tool.
   ```
14. Leave all other settings at default values and click on **Deploy** in the top right corner to deploy your agent:

Make sure **HR Agent** is selected. You can now test your agent:

<img width="1000" alt="image" src="hands-on-lab-assets/hr_step16.png">

For this next part, first select an employee name from the list provided by your instructor and use it for your entire session.

Test your agent in the preview chat on the right side by asking the following questions and validating the responses.  They should look similar to what is shown in the screenshots below:

```
What is the pet policy? 
```
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="hands-on-lab-assets/hr_step13.png">

Next try the following prompts and refer to the image below for further interaction with the agent. 
Reminder: make sure to select an existing employee name from the list provided by your instructor and use the same employee for the entire session.


```
Show me my profile data.
```
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="hands-on-lab-assets/show_profile.png">

```
I'd like to update my title. 
```

<img width="1000" alt="image" src="hands-on-lab-assets/update_title.png">

```
Update my address
```
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="hands-on-lab-assets/update_address.png">

```
What is my time off balance?
```
<img width="1000" alt="image" src="hands-on-lab-assets/show_vacation_balance.png">

```

### Review Domain Agents and Tools (optional)

1. Log into the shared watsonx Orchestrate tenant (URL provided by your instructor).

2. Click on **Discover** in the main hamburger menu to go to the Catalog of agents and tools: 

![](./hands-on-lab-assets/discover.png)

3. Here you will find a list of many pre-built agents and tools that you can filter by category (e.g. Finance, HR, IT), app (e.g. Coupa, Box, Google, etc.):

![catalog](./hands-on-lab-assets/catalog.png)

4. Take a look around, then search for the **SAP Employee Support Manager** agent and select it from the list: 

![search_for_sap](./hands-on-lab-assets/search_for_sap.png)

5. Notice that the supervisory agent **Employee Support Manager** includes 11 collaborator agents:

![employee_support_sap](./hands-on-lab-assets/employee_support_sap.png)

6. Click on one of them and take a look at the tools included, e.g. the **Leave Management** agent:

![alt text](./hands-on-lab-assets/leave_management_agent.png)

Note that it includes functionality similar to what we already implemented in our custom askHR agent.  This is outside the scope of our lab, but in a real enterprise scenario you would start from one of the pre-built domain agent templates and use it as a starting template. 

7. Go back to the Employee Support Manager Agent.  We will not use this today to avoid many multiple copies of the same agent, but notice that each pre-built agent includes the **Use as template** button in the top right corner - this is what allows you to create your own instance of the agent.  Instead of creating a new instance, we will open an existing one that was created by the instructor before the bootcamp.
